### Beta Users

Stores which have a Beta test environment allow you to push your game to it, and let you give restricted access to the Beta users of your game. 

The Beta users you set from the general **Game Info** page will be automatically set for all the stores you will submit your game to. You can set store-specific beta user lists from the [Advanced](Countries and Advanced settings.md) section in the next Publish step.
