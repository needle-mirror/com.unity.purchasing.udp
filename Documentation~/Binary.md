If necessary upload your APK file and OBB files: 

- **APK File**, which is the file of your game or app. If you have pushed your UDP build via Cloud Build, you don’t need to upload it again.
- **OBB File(Main)**, which is the main extension file for additional resources that your game or app might need.
- **OBB File(Patch)**, which is optional and lets you make small updates to the main expansion file.

OBB files do not get pushed during a Cloud Build deployment, so if your game uses them you must upload them manually from the UDP console.

Note that you can change the APK files and OBB files only in the default language view. 

Describe what’s new for the files in the **What’s New** box. UDP publishes this description in the stores together with your game.
