# Building your game and deploying it to the UDP console

There are three ways to build your game and deploy it to the UDP console:

- you [create a local build](Building your game locally.md), and [upload it directly to the UDP console](Uploading your game file to the UDP console directly.md)
- you [create a local build](Building your game locally.md), and [upload it to CloudBuild to deploy it to UDP](Pushing the build to the UDP console via Cloud Build.md)
- [you build your game via CloudBuild, and deploy it to UDP via CloudBuild](Building your game and deploying it to the UDP console.md)

> **Important note**: make sure you [save your IAP Catalog](Save Sync Push your IAP Catalog.md) before building your game.
