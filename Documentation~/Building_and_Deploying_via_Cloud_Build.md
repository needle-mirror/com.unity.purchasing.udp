## Building and Deploying via Cloud Build

If you use Unity Teams Advanced, you can generate builds automatically (see documentation on [Automated Build Generation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityCloudBuildContinuousIntegration.html)). 

In the Cloud Build Services window:

- Select **Manage Build Targets > Add new build target**
- In the **TARGET SETUP** window, set the **PLATFORM** field to Android and enter a useful **TARGET LABEL.** 
- Select **Next: Save.**
- Select **Start Cloud Build**, then select the target build you just created.

Push your build to UDP directly via the Unity Cloud Build Developer Dashboard (as shown in above section)
