# Building your game and deploying it to the UDP console

There are three ways to build your game and deploy it to the UDP console:

- [Create a local build](Building_your_game_locally.md), and [upload it directly to the UDP console](Uploading_your_game_file_to_the_UDP_console_directly.md)
- [Create a local build](Building_your_game_locally.md), and [upload it to CloudBuild to deploy it to UDP](Pushing_the_build_to_the_UDP_console_via_Cloud_Build.md)
- [Build your game via CloudBuild, and deploy it to UDP via CloudBuild](Pushing_the_build_to_the_UDP_console_via_Cloud_Build.md)

> **Note**: make sure you [save your IAP Catalog](Save_Sync_Push_your_IAP_Catalog.md) before building your game.
