### Case of UDP implementation via Unity IAP

In the **IAP Catalog** of Unity IAP:

You will have to **Sync to UDP** every IAP Product that you add to the catalog under the **UDP Configuration** section, using the button immediately below the price field:

Otherwise your IAP Product will NOT be synced with the IAP Catalog on the UDP Console.

Which will ultimately result in this IAP Product not being synced with the store.

**Warning**: closing the IAP Catalog without syncing the changes **doesnâ€™t** pop any warning message, so until we add that in, make sure sync your IAP Products diligently.

The best way to be sure all your IAP Products are synced is to [check the UDP Console](Double-check your IAP Catalog on the UDP Console.md).
