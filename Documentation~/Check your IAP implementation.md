## Check your IAP implementation

### For implementation via the UDP Package

The UDP Package implementation requires that you explicitly 

- initialize UDP 
- query the storeâ€™s IAP inventory
- request to purchase a product
- consume the purchase

as explained in [this section of the UDP Documentation](Client-side implementation of UDP.md).

Please read carefully and ensure your implementation is compliant. Again, [test your IAPs in your generic UDP build](Test your IAPs in the Sandbox environment.md) before repacking it for submission to the stores.
