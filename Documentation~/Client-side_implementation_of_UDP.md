## Client-side implementation

On the client side you can implement your IAPs either with the UDP Package or with [Unity IAP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAP.html).

To understand the difference between the implementations, which one suits you best, and how to avoid mixing them up see [Two different ways to implement UDP](Before_you_begin_know_this.md).
