# Company Information

Before publishing your game to the UDP console, you need to create a company information profile. UDP sends this company information to the partner stores, who use it to populate the “About the developer” section of your game’s listing on their app store.  

1. On the [UDP console](https://distribute.dashboard.unity.com), choose your organization and click on the pencil icon to edit the profile.![img](images/image_38.png)
