### Countries and Advanced settings

Click **Countries** and select the countries that you want to distribute your game to. 

Click **Advanced** to configure more store-specific settings. 

The following properties can be configured specifically for a store:

| Property   | Function                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Target SDK | The version of the store SDK that you publish your game to. By default, UDP repacks for the latest version of the store SDK. |
| IAP        | The name, price and currency for your IAP products           |
| Beta Users | Specifies the users who can receive a link to the game. This list is inherited from the Beta Users list in the **Game Info** section, and can be further edited. Note that only stores with the **Test** target step have this property. |
