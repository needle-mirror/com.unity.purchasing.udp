### Create a new game

You can create a game placeholder on the UDP console, and later link it to an actual UDP project. 

Click on the blank card to create a new game. 

This will send you to your new gameâ€™s **Game Info** page where you can [edit your game information](Editing your game information on the UDP console.md).

**Important note**: you will need to link your Unity project with your **UDP client** in the Unity Editor (refer to [Generating a UDP client](Generating a UDP client.md)).

**Why would I create my game from the UDP console**? Using the [Unity Organization](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OrgsManagingyourOrganization.html) system, this allows a user to create a game instance on the UDP console and prepare it for distribution (typically the Owner) and give a developer within the same Organization the UDP client ID so that he/she can carry out the UDP integration, build the game, and deploy it to the console.
