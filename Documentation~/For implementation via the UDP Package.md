### For implementation via the UDP Package

The UDP Package implementation requires that you explicitly 

- initialize UDP 
- query the storeâ€™s IAP inventory
- request to purchase a product
- consume the purchase

as explained in [this section of the UDP Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.purchasing.udp@1.0/manual/Implementing-UDP-IAP-on-the-client-side.html).

Please read carefully and ensure your implementation is compliant. Again, [test your IAPs in your generic UDP build](Test your IAPs in the Sandbox environment.md) before repacking it for submission to the stores.
