# Implementing in-app purchases

In-app purchases (IAPs) let you sell in-app contents to players. To leverage the power of IAP, you can implement either the UDP Package or UDP with [Unity IAP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAP.html). If your game is already using Unity IAP, we recommend you implement UDP with Unity IAP. Otherwise you are free to choose the implementation of your choice. Note that this documentation privileges the implementation via the UDP Package.

Note that the UDP Package and UDP with Unity IAP use different sets of APIs. If you use the UDP Package, implement the corresponding API. 

This section shows you how to:

* [Implement UDP in-app purchases with the UDP package](Implementing-UDP-IAP.md)

* [Implement UDP in-app purchases with Unity IAP](Implementing-UDP-IAP.md)

* [Manage in-app purchases on the UDP console](Managing-IAP-on-UDP-console.md)
