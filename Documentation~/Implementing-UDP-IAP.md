## Implementing UDP in-app purchases with the UDP package

To use UDP IAP, implement the integration on the client and the server sides. If your game is offline, you only need to implement the client-side integration. If your game is online, you can choose whether to implement the server-side integration.
* [Implementing UDP IAP on the client side](Implementing-UDP-IAP-on-the-client-side.md)

The implementation on the client side includes initializing the UDP SDK and integrating with the in-app purchase flow of UDP.

* [Implementing UDP IAP on the server side](Implementing-UDP-IAP-on-the-server-side.md)

The implementation on the server side lets you query the UDP server about orders, receive callback notifications, and send back the acknowledgements.
