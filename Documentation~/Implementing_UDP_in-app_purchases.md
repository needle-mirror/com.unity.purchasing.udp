# Implementing UDP in-app purchases

In-app purchases (IAPs) let you sell in-app contents to players. 

To use UDP in-app purchases, implement the integration on the client and the server sides. If your game is offline, you only need to implement the client-side integration. If your game is online, you can opt to also implement the server-side integration.

- Implementing UDP in-app purchases on the client side</br>
  The implementation on the client side includes initializing the UDP SDK and integrating with the in-app purchase flow of UDP.

- Implementing UDP in-app purchases on the server side</br>
  The implementation on the server side lets you query the UDP server about orders, receive callback notifications, and return the acknowledgements.

This section shows you how to:

- [Implement in-app purchases on the client side](Client-side_implementation_of_UDP.md)
  - with the UDP package
  - or with Unity IAP
- [Implement in-app purchases on the server side](Server-side_implementation_of_UDP.md)
- [Manage in-app purchases on the UDP console](Managing_in-app_purchases_on_the_UDP_console.md)
