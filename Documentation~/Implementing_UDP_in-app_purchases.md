# Implementing UDP in-app purchases

In-app purchases (IAPs) let you sell in-app contents to players. 

To use UDP in-app purchases, implement the integration on the client and the server sides. If your game is offline, you only need to implement the client-side integration. If your game is online, you can opt to also implement the server-side integration.

- Implementing UDP in-app purchases on the client side
  The implementation on the client side includes initializing the UDP SDK and integrating with the in-app purchase flow of UDP.

- Implementing UDP in-app purchases on the server side
  The implementation on the server side lets you query the UDP server about orders, receive callback notifications, and return the acknowledgements.

This section shows you how to:

- [Implement in-app purchases on the client side](Client-side_implementation_of_UDP.md)
  - with the UDP package
  - or with Unity IAP
- [Implement in-app purchases on the server side](Server-side_implementation_of_UDP.md)
- [Manage in-app purchases on the UDP console](Managing_in-app_purchases_on_the_UDP_console.md)
