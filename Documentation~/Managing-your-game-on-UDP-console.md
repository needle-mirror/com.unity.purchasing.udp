# Managing and publishing your game on the UDP console

The UDP console is a web-based platform where you can manage your games before submitting them to stores. The UDP console lets you:

* [Edit the game information](Editing-game-info.md)

* Edit in-app purchases

* [Publish your game to partner stores](Publishing-to-stores.md)

You can go to the UDP console via the URL [https://distribute.dashboard.unity.com](https://distribute.dashboard.unity.com). 

From the Unity Editor, find the **Go to UDP console** button at the bottom of the **Window** > **Unity Distribution Portal** > **Settings** Inspector window.
