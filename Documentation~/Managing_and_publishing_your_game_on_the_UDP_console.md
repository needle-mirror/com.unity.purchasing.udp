# Managing and publishing your game on the UDP console

The [UDP console](https://distribute.dashboard.unity.com) is a web-based platform where you can manage your games before submitting them to stores. The UDP console lets you:

- [Edit the game information](Editing_your_game_information_on_the_UDP_console.md)
- [Edit in-app purchases](Editing_your_game_information_on_the_UDP_console.md)
- [Publish your game to partner stores](Publishing_your_game_to_stores.md)
- [View your games’ performance across UDP stores](Reporting.md)

> **Note**: make sure you successfully test your game’s IAPs in the Sandbox environment before continuing to this stage. If your IAPs don’t work in your generic UDP build, the versions that you’d submit to the stores would certainly not work either. For more information, see [UDP Sandbox Test Accounts](Configuring_Unity_Distribution_Portal.md).

You can go to the UDP console via the URL <https://distribute.dashboard.unity.com>. 

From the Unity Editor, find the **Go to UDP console** button at the bottom of the **Window > Unity Distribution Portal > Settings** Inspector window.
