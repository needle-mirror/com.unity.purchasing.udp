### Switch between UDP projects

Select the card of the game you want to work on. This will send you to the game’s corresponding **Game Info** page where you can [edit your game information](Editing-game-info.md), and from there [publish your game and view its status](Publishing-to-stores.md).

A game card has a status "Published" if it has been submitted to and accepted by at least one partner store.

### Create a new game

This will send you to your new game’s **Game Info** page where you can [edit your game information](Editing-game-info.md).

Click on the **More** link to access more information on a store: overview, FAQs, and other useful links specific to each store.

## Company Information

Before publishing your game to the UDP console, you need to create a company information profile. UDP sends this company information to the partner stores, who use it to populate the "About the developer" section of your game’s listing on their app store.  

1. On the [UDP console](https://distribute.dashboard.unity.com), choose your organization and click on the pencil icon to edit the profile.
