### Pushing the build to the UDP console via Cloud Build

In the Editor, enable Cloud Build through the Unity Services window (see documentation on [Cloud Build implementation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityCloudBuild.html)).

You can upload your game build to the build history of your Project, and push it to UDP either <u>via the Editor</u>, or <u>via the Unity Cloud Build Developer Dashboard</u>.
