### Release your revision

Only RELEASED revisions can be published to stores. 

You need to have at least one IAP product defined in order to release a revision. 

Once you have saved your Revision Draft and are ready to publish it, click the **RELEASE** button. Enter release notes to keep track of your revision.

**Note**: only the last revision will be published to the stores. If you need to submit an older revision, edit it and re-release it so it becomes the latest one.
