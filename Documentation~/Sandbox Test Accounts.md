### Sandbox Test Accounts

Your generic UDP game build, when it launches in the UDP Sandbox environment, will ask the user for access credentials. You define and manage these credentials in that section. 

Sandbox Test Accounts are also covered under [this section](UDP Sandbox Test Accounts.md)

The information you edit on the UDP console will be synced with the Unity Editor once you save your Revision draft.

**Note**: the test accounts are only for the UDP Sandbox environment, and will only apply to the generic UDP build. Once a game is repacked for a specific store, it no longer points to the sandbox environment where the test accounts belong.
