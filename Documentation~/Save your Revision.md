### Save your Revision

Once you entered all the game information for this revision, including in all the languages, save your changes using the **SAVE** button. 

Saving your changes will only save your Revision Draft. [Release your Revision Draft](Release your revision.md) to create a new Revision which can be submitted to stores.

**Note**: you can overwrite an existing Revision Draft by editing a previously-released Revision and saving the ensuing draft. The latter will become the latest Revision Draft.

Refer to the FAQ section for more information about the concept of [Revisions and Releases](The UDP console.md)
