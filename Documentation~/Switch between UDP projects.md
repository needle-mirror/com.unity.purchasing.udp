### Switch between UDP projects

Select the card of the game you want to work on. This will send you to the game’s corresponding **Game Info** page where you can [edit your game information](Editing your game information on the UDP console.md), and from there [publish your game and view its status](Publishing your game to stores.md).

A game card has a status “Published” if it has been submitted to and accepted by at least one partner store.
