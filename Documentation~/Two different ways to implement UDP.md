## Two different ways to implement UDP

There are 2 ways to implement UDP in your game:

- **Using Unity IAP**. If your game is already using Unity IAP, it should be the obvious choice

- **Using the UDP Package**. We designed this implementation to be similar to the Google Play In-App Billing implementation, so that if your game was originally wired that way then porting it to UDP should be straightforward

You are free to choose either implementation, but it is important you stick to **ONLY ONE**. More on that [here](Do not mix the implementations.md). 

Below is a quick run-down of both options.
