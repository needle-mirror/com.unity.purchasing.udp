## Uploading your game file to the UDP console directly

You can create a local build in the Unity Editor and upload it to the UDP console directly.

1. On the [UDP console](https://distribute.dashboard.unity3d.com/), navigate to your Project via **My Games**
2. Select **GAME INFO > Basic**
3. Click **APK Files** to upload the APK file of your game.

**Note**: only APKs with a UDP implementation will be accepted by the UDP console.
