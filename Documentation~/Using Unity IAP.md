### Using Unity IAP

From version 1.22 and above, you can implement UDP directly from Unity IAP ([how to get set up](Using Unity IAP-detail.md))

If your game is already using Unity IAP, it should be the obvious and simplest choice.

Make sure you follow the general implementation guidelines in [Unity IAPâ€™s Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAP.html).

Check the details of the [Editor UI elements involved in implementing UDP via Unity IAP](Editor UI elements for UDP implementation via Unity IAP.md).
