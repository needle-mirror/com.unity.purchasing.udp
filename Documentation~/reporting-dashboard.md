# Reporting dashboard

Monitor the performance of your published games from the **Reporting** dashboard, which is accessible from the top navigation bar:

You can filter the information presented on the Reporting dashboard by game and/or by store.

If you don’t select anything in the **All Games** and **All Stores** filters for the whole Reporting dashboard, you can view breakdowns on an individual chart level (where applicable). On supported charts, click the **by store** or **by game** filters to view performance on specific stores or for individual games.

The Reporting dashboard is divided into 5 panels, all subjected to the Games and Stores filters.

**Note**: The Huawei AppGallery only returns revenue information to UDP if you’ve set up server-side validation using QueryOrder. If you used callback notifications, no revenue-related charts or information is available for Huawei.
